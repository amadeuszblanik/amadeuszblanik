### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,
With over 6 years of commercial experience and more than 14 years of hobby coding experience, I am a seasoned Frontend Developer and Tech Lead for Frontend & Mobile Technologies. In my current role, I lead teams and work as an active developer to deliver high-quality software products that are user-friendly, efficient, and scalable.

Throughout my career, I have served in various roles, starting as a Frontend Developer and gradually progressing to Senior Frontend Developer, Team Leader Frontend Developer, and ultimately, Tech Lead. My experience spans various industries, and I have worked with businesses of different sizes.

My top skills include TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js, and I have a passion for staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the field. As a remote worker based in Gliwice, Poland, I have collaborated with teams from all over the world and have developed an understanding of how to successfully communicate and lead teams to achieve their goals.
